# awkscripts
A collection of useful awk scripts I've written over the years

These are very simple scripts that allow manipulation of table-type files, that is, 
files that are delimited (tab, e.g.) and that have a row/column type structure and generally
have an identifier key that is often (though not always) unique. They all output to stdout 
and can be included in piped commands.

Please note: I've not included any error catching and behavior can be undesirable/unexpected
             in some cases.
